Design considerations

# Design considerations for cloud native applications

When building an application it is important to spend a considerable amount of time on factors which can help us in choosing an efficient architecture.
Well implemented fundamentals can enable us in creating services which are scalable, resilient and extensible.
There are mainly two factors - 

## 1. Functional requirements

Which services the application should deliver to the consumers. Some points to be considered - 
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What functionalities do we want?
- Who are the end-users?
- Input and Output process
- Which teams are most suitable to build the applicaiton?

## 2. Available resources

Second factor is to determine the availability of resources which will be used in the implementation of the project.
- Engineering resources
- Financial resources
- Time constraints
- Internal knowledge
